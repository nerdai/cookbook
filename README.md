# üìñ Streamlit Cookbook

Streamlit Cookbook is a compilation of Streamlit app templates that you can use as boilerplate code to jumpstart your own app creation endeavors.

In a nutshell, each recipe allows you to quickly spin up a working Streamlit app that implements the library/tool of interest. 

## üßë‚Äçüç≥ How to use this cookbook?
For your convenience, we've categorized tool integrations by library name. For instance, Streamlit app built using OpenAI is a sub-folder in the `replicate` folder, thus `recipes/replicate`.
