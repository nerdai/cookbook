# 📖 Streamlit Cookbook

Streamlit Cookbook is a compilation of Streamlit app templates that you can use as boilerplate code to jumpstart your own app creation endeavors.

In a nutshell, each recipe allows you to quickly spin up a working Streamlit app that implements the library/tool of interest. 

## 🧑‍🍳 How to use this cookbook?
For your convenience, we've categorized tool integrations by library name. For instance, Streamlit app built using OpenAI is a sub-folder in the `replicate` folder, thus `recipes/replicate`.

## 🏃 How to run the app?
To run the app, start by installing Streamlit on the command line using the `pip install streamlit` command. Next, change into the directory and launch the app via `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.
